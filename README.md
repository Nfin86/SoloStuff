SoloStuff
A collection of my personal programming projects, built with Python (and a splash of JS soon!).

## Projects
- **Mouse Macro Tool** (`mouse_macro.py`)  
  - Records and replays mouse movements/clicks.  
  - Built with Python, PyQt6, pynput, and pyautogui.  
  - Status: Working, with fancy pulsing buttons—more polish TBD!  
- **Rock, Paper, Scissors Game** (`game.py`)  
  - A simple GUI game to beat the computer.  
  - Built with Python and Tkinter.  
  - Status: Complete, basic but functional.

## Goals
- Add more projects (web apps, scripts, etc.).  
- Experiment with JavaScript next.  
- Open to feedback—feel free to suggest ideas!# SoloStuff
